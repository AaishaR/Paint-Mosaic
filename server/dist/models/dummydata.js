As a result, she created handcrafted hollowware and jewelry out of traditional materials such as sterling silver and enamel, yet she imbued her dynamic pieces with colorful, energetic patterns. In this work, Craver married the smooth surfaces, decorative flourishes, and exquisite workmanship of Scandinavian design with the unified geometry of Art Deco decoration",
